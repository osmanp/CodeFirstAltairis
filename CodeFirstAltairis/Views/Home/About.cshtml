<h2>About EF Code First/Altairis Example App</h2>
<p>This is an example ASP.Net MVC3 application using Entity Framework 4.1 Code First (&quot;Magic Unicorn Edition&quot;) and the <a href="http://altairiswebsecurity.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Altairis Web Security Toolkit</a>, which is a simplified membership provider. 
    The key feature is that the database is generated by the EF4.1 code first POCO models which eases development using Code First methodology.
    This allows the membership info to be in the same database as the application and it won't have to be regenerated by SQL commands each time the models are changed.
</p>
<p>To test the roles aspect, login as <b>user</b> (pwd = password) to see a limited role, and login as <b>admin</b> (pwd = password) to see the administrator role.</p>
